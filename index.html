            <h3>Introduction and Appearance</h3>
            <p>Red pandas (Ailurus fulgens) are small mammals found in the eastern Himalayas and parts of China. Although they share part of their name with the giant panda, they’re not closely related—red pandas belong to their own unique family, Ailuridae.<br>

                They are about the size of a domestic cat, with reddish-brown fur, white markings on their face, and a long, striped, bushy tail. Their features help them camouflage in the forest canopy. Red pandas have strong claws and a special “false thumb” that helps them grip bamboo and climb trees skillfully.</p>
