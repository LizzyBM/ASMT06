            <h3>Introduction and Appearance</h3>
            <p>Red pandas (Ailurus fulgens) are small mammals found in the eastern Himalayas and parts of China. Although they share part of their name with the giant panda, they’re not closely related—red pandas belong to their own unique family, Ailuridae.<br>

                They are about the size of a domestic cat, with reddish-brown fur, white markings on their face, and a long, striped, bushy tail. Their features help them camouflage in the forest canopy. Red pandas have strong claws and a special “false thumb” that helps them grip bamboo and climb trees skillfully.</p>

            <h3>Part 2: Habitat, Diet & Behavior</h3>
            <p>Red pandas live in cool, temperate forests at high elevations—usually between 2,200 and 4,800 meters (7,200–15,700 feet). These forests are rich in bamboo, which makes up the majority of their diet. Though they are classified as carnivores, red pandas mostly eat bamboo shoots and leaves, but they may also eat fruits, berries, insects, and small animals.<br>
            They are solitary animals and are most active during the early morning and evening (crepuscular). Red pandas spend much of their time in trees, where they are agile climbers and often sleep curled up on branches during the day.</p>

            <h3>Part 3: Conservation & Threats</h3>
            <p>Red pandas are currently listed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It’s estimated that fewer than 10,000 remain in the wild. The biggest threats they face are habitat loss, deforestation, illegal hunting, and the impact of climate change on bamboo forests.<br>
                Conservation efforts are underway, including protected nature reserves, anti-poaching patrols, and captive breeding programs. Education and awareness are also important in helping protect these unique and beautiful animals.</p>
